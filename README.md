Hardware and software consultant from Oslo/Norway. [Get in touch](https://maketronics.no/about/) if you need custom hardware. I mostly consult on electronics for industrial and IoT, but I also do museeum exhibits and marketing. Just like my work, my public repositories are a good mix of hardware (mostly Kicad projects) and Software (JS/C++). From 2013 to 2023 I built up and lectured hardware/IoT topics for [Kristiania University](https://www.kristiania.no/), so several repositories contain content from lectures as well.

Whenever my clients allow me or I do personal projects, I'll post libraries and code that can be useful to others. Please send a PR if any of my code needs fixing. Reach me on Twitter as @jenschr or [via my Blog](https://flashgamer.com)
