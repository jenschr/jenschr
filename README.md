Hardware and software consultant from Norway. I mostly consult on electronics for industrial and IoT, but I also do odd jobs in between. I also lecture and create hardware/IoT topics for [Kristiania University](https://www.kristiania.no/). Just like my work, my public repositories are a good mix of hardware (mostly Kicad projects) and Software (JS/C++).

Whenever my clients allow me or I do personal projects, I'll post libraries and code that can be useful to others. Please send a PR if any of my code needs fixing. Reach me on Twitter as @jenschr or [via my Blog](https://flashgamer.com)
